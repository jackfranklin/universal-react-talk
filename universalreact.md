---

"Surprisingly, the proportion of people that have explicitly disabled JavaScript or use a browser that doesn't support JavaScript, __only makes up a small slice of people that don't run JavaScript__."

---

"Progressive enhancement has never been about users who've turned JavaScript off, or least it wasn't for me."

[Jake Archibald, "Progressive Enhancement Still Important"](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-still-important/)

---

## Everyone has JS, right?

- On a train / in a tunnel / etc
- HTTP request hangs
- Firewalls
- ISP is interfering
- A browser addon is messing with you
- Your CDN is down

# Time and a place

---

A standard React app:

```javascript
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  render() { ...  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyApp />,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

---

Server side:

```javascript
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  render() { ...  }
}

ReactDOM.renderToString(
  <MyApp />,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

---

# React is a great fit

---

---

# Demo One!

Rendering HTML on the server from a React component

---

```js
// some imports left out to save space
import React from 'react';
import MyApp from './component';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

const app = express();

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const markup = renderToString(<MyApp />);
  res.render('index', { markup });
});

```

---

# renderToString
When your HTML is going to be picked up by React on the client

# renderToStaticMarkup
When your HTML is never going to be edited by client-side React

---

# Going Client side

- Shared set of components that are environment agnostic
- A server rendering step (like we just saw)
- A client rendering step
- A bundler to generate our client side JavaScript

---

# Agnostic Components

---

# Webpack

A JavaScript application bundler that will generate our client side build.

---

# Rendering on the Client

---

Updating our server template.

```html
<body>
  <!-- rendering React into body is bad -->
  <!-- lack of whitespace here is really important! -->
  <div id="app"><%- markup %></div>
  <script src="build.js"></script>
</body>
```

---

Creating __client.js__:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import MyApp from './component';

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyApp />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

---

# Same Components on client and server

---

```
npm install --save-dev webpack babel-loader
```

---

Create __webpack.config.js__

```javascript
var path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(process.cwd(), 'client.js'),
  output: {
    path: './public/',
    filename: 'build.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /.js$/,
        loader: 'babel'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

Run `webpack`:

```
> webpack
Hash: 78c865d5593fe910f823
Version: webpack 1.12.12
Time: 4948ms
   Asset    Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
   build.js  690 kB       0  [emitted]  main
       + 160 hidden modules
```

(Tip: `webpack -w` for continuous rebuilds)

---

# An interactive component

```javascript
export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  onClick() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.onClick.bind(this)}>Click Me</button>
        <p>Count: { this.state.count }</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

# Demo Two!

(Contrived example incoming!)

---

Most web apps still do a lot of rendering of data (from APIs, etc) and why would you prevent your non-JS users from that?

---

# A read-only experience is way better than no experience.

# Routing

#Â Don't be that person who breaks the web.

# react-router

The defacto, practically standard routing solution for React.

# react-router 2.0.0-rc5

We're living on the bleeding edge here!

[React Router 2.0 upgrade guide](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/upgrade-guides/v2.0.0.md)

---

First we need some more components, starting with __components/app.js__:

```js
import React from 'react';

export default class AppComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>My web 2.0 app</h2>
        { this.props.children }
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

`this.props.children` are the nested routes.

---

And then __components/index.js__:

```js
import React from 'react';

export default class IndexComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>This is the index page</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

---

Define our routes:

```javascript
import { Route } from 'react-router';
import React from 'react';

import AppComponent from './components/app';
import IndexComponent from './components/index';

export const routes = (
  <Route path="" component={AppComponent}>
    <Route path="/" component={IndexComponent} />
  </Route>
);
```

---

Match against the URL on the server.

Gets a bit hairy, stick with me!

[React Router server side guide](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/advanced/ServerRendering.md)

---

```javascript
// our newly defined routes
import { routes } from './routes';

// match is responsible for matching routes against a URL
// RouterContext renders the components in the matched routes
import { match, RouterContext } from 'react-router';
```
---

```javascript

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  match({ routes, location: req.url }, (error, redirectLocation, renderProps) => {
    if (error) {
      res.status(500).send(error.message)
    } else if (redirectLocation) {
      res.redirect(302, redirectLocation.pathname + redirectLocation.search)
    } else if (renderProps) {
      res.render('index', {
        markup: renderToString(<RouterContext {...renderProps} />)
      });
    } else {
      res.status(404).send('Not found')
    }
  })
});
```

---

# Let's break that down...

---

```javascript
// take our app's routes, and the URL of the request
match({ routes, location: req.url }, (error, redirectLocation, renderProps) => {
  // match figures out which routes match, and calls this callback with the arguments above

  // error : given if something went wrong matching a route

  // redirectLocation : returned if the URL matches a redirect

  // renderProps : given if a route was matched and we can render
  ...
});
```

---

```javascript
if (error) {
  // if there was an error, 500 with the error message

  // you might show a custom error HTML page here

  res.status(500).send(error.message)

} else if (redirectLocation) {
  ...
}
```

---
```javascript
  ...
} else if (redirectLocation) {
  // if we need to redirect, redirect to the new URL

  res.redirect(302, redirectLocation.pathname + redirectLocation.search)

} else if (renderProps) {
  ...
}
```

---

```javascript
  ...
} else if (renderProps) {
  // if we have renderProps that means we have a match and can render
  res.render('index', {
    // RouterContext is React Router's wrapper around our own components

    // and renderProps contains all the info React Router needs to render our app
    markup: renderToString(<RouterContext {...renderProps} />)
  });
} else {
  ...
}
```

---

```javascript
} else {
  // if we get here, it's not an error, redirect or match
  // hence, 404!
  res.status(404).send('Not found')
}
```

---

---

Let's add an about page!

---

__components/about.js__:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default class AboutComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Rockstar developer</p>;
  }
}
```
---

__routes.js__:

```javascript
import AppComponent from './components/app';
import IndexComponent from './components/index';
import AboutComponent from './components/about';
import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router';


export const routes = (
  <Route path="" component={AppComponent}>
    <Route path="/" component={IndexComponent} />
    <Route path="/about" component={AboutComponent} />
  </Route>
);
```

---

And some links...

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router';

export default class AppComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>My web 2.0 app</h2>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        { this.props.children }
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

---

With no client side bundle, this works perfectly:

![inline](routing-demo.mov)

---

Updating the client side:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { Router, browserHistory } from 'react-router';
import { routes } from './routes';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router routes={routes} history={browserHistory} />,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

And then rerun `webpack`.

# Demo Three!

---

# Dealing with Data

(If I have time...)

---

# (Caveat: this area is still WIP)

No one has quite figured out the best way to deal with loading data on the server and client with React components.

But I'm a fan of [Async Props](https://github.com/rackt/async-props) (also by the creator's of React Router).

Warning: Async Props is not production ready yet.
