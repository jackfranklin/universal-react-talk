"Surprisingly, the proportion of people that have explicitly disabled JavaScript or use a browser that doesn't support JavaScript, __only makes up a small slice of people that don't run JavaScript__."

---

"Progressive enhancement has never been about users who've turned JavaScript off, or least it wasn't for me."

## Everyone has JS, right?

- On a train / in a tunnel / etc
- HTTP request hangs
- Firewalls
- ISP is interfering
- A browser addon is messing with you
- Your CDN is down

# Time and a place

# Cutting Edge!

We're really still at the early stages of figuring out how this stuff works.

Some of the code shown here isn't the easiest, or the APIs aren't that straight forward.

This will change as we learn more. Don't expect this to be 100% smooth!

# React is a great fit

Code and demos: https://github.com/jackfranklin/universal-react-talk/tree/fluent-conf-version

---

A standard React app:

```javascript
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  render() { ...  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyApp />,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

---

Server side:

```javascript
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  render() { ...  }
}

ReactDOM.renderToString(<MyApp />)
```

---

```js
// some imports left out to save space
import React from 'react';
import MyApp from './component';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';

const app = express();

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  const markup = renderToString(<MyApp />);
  res.render('index', { markup });
});

```

---

# renderToString
When your HTML is going to be picked up by React on the client

# renderToStaticMarkup
When your HTML is never going to be edited by client-side React

---

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My App</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p data-reactid=".nbhys48o3k" data-react-checksum="-1312485142">Hello from React</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

# Going Client side

- Shared set of components that are environment agnostic
- A server rendering step (like we just saw)
- A client rendering step
- A bundler to generate our client side JavaScript

---

# There's no requirement to actually go client side

A server side generated React app with no client side JS is perfectly fine.

---

# Agnostic Components

---

# Webpack

A JavaScript application bundler that will generate our client side build.

---

# Rendering on the Client

---

Updating our server template.

```html
<body>
  <!-- rendering React into body is bad -->
  <!-- lack of whitespace here is really important! -->
  <div id="app"><%- markup %></div>
  <script src="build.js"></script>
</body>
```

---

Creating __client.js__:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import MyApp from './component';

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyApp />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

---

# Same Components on client and server

---

```
npm install --save-dev webpack babel-loader
```

---

Create __webpack.config.js__

```javascript
var path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(process.cwd(), 'client.js'),
  output: {
    path: './public/',
    filename: 'build.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /.js$/,
        loader: 'babel'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

Run `webpack`:

```
> webpack
Hash: 78c865d5593fe910f823
Version: webpack 1.12.12
Time: 4948ms
   Asset    Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
   build.js  690 kB       0  [emitted]  main
       + 160 hidden modules
```

(Tip: `webpack -w` for continuous rebuilds)

---

# An interactive component

```javascript
export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  onClick() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.onClick.bind(this)}>Click Me</button>
        <p>Count: { this.state.count }</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Most web apps still do a lot of rendering of data (from APIs, etc) and why would you prevent your non-JS users from that?

---

# A read-only experience is way better than no experience.

---

# Routing

---

#Â Don't be that person who breaks the web.

---

# react-router

The defacto, practically standard routing solution for React.

https://github.com/rackt/react-router

---

First we need some more components, starting with __components/app.js__:

```js
import React from 'react';

export default class AppComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>My web 2.0 app</h2>
        { this.props.children }
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

`this.props.children` are the nested routes.

---

And then __components/index.js__:

```js
import React from 'react';

export default class IndexComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>This is the index page</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

---

Define our routes:

```javascript
import { Route } from 'react-router';
import React from 'react';

import AppComponent from './components/app';
import IndexComponent from './components/index';

export const routes = (
  <Route path="" component={AppComponent}>
    <Route path="/" component={IndexComponent} />
  </Route>
);
```

---

Match against the URL on the server.

Gets a bit hairy, stick with me!

[React Router server side guide](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/advanced/ServerRendering.md)

---

```javascript
// our newly defined routes
import { routes } from './routes';

// match is responsible for matching routes against a URL
// RouterContext renders the components in the matched routes
import { match, RouterContext } from 'react-router';
```
---

```javascript

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  match({ routes, location: req.url }, (error, redirectLocation, renderProps) => {
    if (error) {
      res.status(500).send(error.message)
    } else if (redirectLocation) {
      res.redirect(302, redirectLocation.pathname + redirectLocation.search)
    } else if (renderProps) {
      res.render('index', {
        markup: renderToString(<RouterContext {...renderProps} />)
      });
    } else {
      res.status(404).send('Not found')
    }
  })
});
```

---

# Let's break that down...

---

```javascript
// take our app's routes, and the URL of the request
match({ routes, location: req.url }, (error, redirectLocation, renderProps) => {
  // match figures out which routes match, and calls this callback with the arguments above

  // error : given if something went wrong matching a route

  // redirectLocation : returned if the URL matches a redirect

  // renderProps : given if a route was matched and we can render
  ...
});
```

---

```javascript
if (error) {
  // if there was an error, 500 with the error message

  // you might show a custom error HTML page here

  res.status(500).send(error.message)

} else if (redirectLocation) {
  ...
}
```

---
```javascript
  ...
} else if (redirectLocation) {
  // if we need to redirect, redirect to the new URL

  res.redirect(302, redirectLocation.pathname + redirectLocation.search)

} else if (renderProps) {
  ...
}
```

---

```javascript
  ...
} else if (renderProps) {
  // if we have renderProps that means we have a match and can render
  res.render('index', {
    // RouterContext is React Router's wrapper around our own components

    // and renderProps contains all the info React Router needs to render our app
    markup: renderToString(<RouterContext {...renderProps} />)
  });
} else {
  ...
}
```

---

```javascript
} else {
  // if we get here, it's not an error, redirect or match
  // hence, 404!
  res.status(404).send('Not found')
}
```

---

![fit](routing.png)

---

Let's add an about page!

---

__components/about.js__:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default class AboutComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Rockstar developer</p>;
  }
}
```
---

__routes.js__:

```javascript
import AppComponent from './components/app';
import IndexComponent from './components/index';
import AboutComponent from './components/about';
import React from 'react';
import { Route } from 'react-router';


export const routes = (
  <Route path="" component={AppComponent}>
    <Route path="/" component={IndexComponent} />
    <Route path="/about" component={AboutComponent} />
  </Route>
);
```

---

And some links...

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router';

export default class AppComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>My web 2.0 app</h2>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        { this.props.children }
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

---

With no client side bundle, this works perfectly:

![inline](routing-demo.mov)

---

Updating the client side:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { Router, browserHistory } from 'react-router';
import { routes } from './routes';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router routes={routes} history={browserHistory} />,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

And then rerun `webpack`.

# Dealing with Data on the server and client

---

# (Caveat: this area is still WIP)

No one has quite figured out the best way to deal with loading data on the server and client with React components.

This is very, very new terrirory and things are not settled yet. This will get a little messy!

---

1. We want to be able to fetch data on the server and/or on the client.
2. If the data is loaded on the server and rendered to the client, we ideally want to avoid making the request again.

---

[Async Props](https://github.com/rackt/async-props) (also by the creator's of React Router).

Not production ready, still a WIP. Check `code/with-async-data` on GitHub for an example.

---

First, let's give __components/index.js__ some data:

```javascript
export default class IndexComponent extends React.Component {
  // a stage 1 proposal for ES.next
  static loadProps(params, cb) {
    fetchGithubData('jackfranklin').then((data) => {
      cb(null, { github: data });
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>My github repo count: { this.props.github.public_repos }</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

---

Then we update our server and client rendering.

`AsyncProps` generates a `script` that will contain the fetched data from the server.

The client can pick this data up and avoid having to make the request all over again.

---

# This is one of many approaches.

---

[React Resolver](https://github.com/ericclemmons/react-resolver)

__code/with-react-resolver__ has an example.

```js
class IndexComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>This is the index page</p>
        <p>My github repo count: { this.props.github.public_repos }</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default resolve('github', (props) => {
  return fetch('https://api.github.com/users/jackfranklin').then((data) => {
    return data.json();
  });
})(IndexComponent);
```

---

- Update the server side rendering to include `window.__REACT_RESOLVER_PAYLOAD__`.
- Update the client side rendering to use React Resolver.
- All data is resolved on the server, rendered and then used to populate data on the client.

This area is still being figured out - more solutions will definitely come!
